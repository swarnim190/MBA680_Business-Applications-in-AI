Day 7
I explored Cursor’s features and used it to help me improve the way posts are displayed in the app. submitPost() function in the .js file is modified so that each post is broken into separate sections: a bold title showing "Day X" at the top, the user’s post content displayed underneath, and a smaller, italicized timestamp at the bottom, very similar to how LinkedIn formats posts. CSS is also updated to create a clearer visual hierarchy, improving readability with better spacing and styling. Cursor made it really easy to suggest these changes and helped me polish both the structure and the design. After finishing the updates, I committed everything to GitHub.
