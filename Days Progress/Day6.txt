Day 6:
I used Cursor to add a new feature: the ability for users to personalize the tracker’s title with their name. I added an input box and a "Personalize Tracker" button, styled the new section with CSS, and wrote a JavaScript function called updateTrackerName() to update the page header and browser title when a user enters their name. Now instead of just saying "7 Days of AI Tracker," the app can display "[User’s Name]’s 7 Days of AI Tracker." I also updated the README file to document this new feature. These last touches really made the project feel more complete and polished, and I committed the final version of the project to GitHub.
